Why did you need to write a remove method in the KenkenIterator class even though your program never actually needs to remove any cells from the puzzle?

The remove method was needed to complete the Interface. Because Iterator doesn’t provide a method body for hasNext, next, and remove. I had to create them myself to use it.
 
Look at the files in your project directory.  Describe what is different about the .class file for the KenkenIterator class and explain the reason.

the KenkenIterator class is the only class file with a main method. That is because it calls all the necessary files to validate the Kenken puzzle
 
Explain how long it takes your isSolution method to run on different sized puzzles in terms of Big-O notation.  Assume that the number of constraints is a constant times the size of the puzzle (which is approximately true).
n^2 max, sometimes n and sometimes n^3. The reason for the n^3 was to print the array values of a failed row/column. otherwise it ran at most n^2
